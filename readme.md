## What is this repo about?
This was made as project assignment during the third semester of my bachelors in CS at TU. This repo contains the circuit diagrams of a 2-bit ALU with the following features:

- Addition
- Multiplication
- Division
- Comparison
- Left shift
- bitwise AND
- bitwise XOR

The necessary documentation can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d9dpcaoh0luv5twTwo%20Bit%20%ALU%20Documentation.pdf?dl=0).

Although I've made the best efforts to make these as error-free as possible, I do not guarantee the accuracy of these diagrams by any means. So, I would not recommend following these circuit diagrams as the only source of truth while implementing any of the circuits in hardware. A lot of the circuits could be improved upon, especially in terms of gate cost.

## How to view the files?
I have used the [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital) app made by [@hneemann](https://github.com/hneemann) and therefore, you need to download that in order to view any of the circuit diagrams. The download link is available in the repo link provided. 

Keep in mind, the software requires Java runtime to be installed on your system. If you don't have Java already installed, you can do so by following [this](https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp) link.

## Where can I use the files?
Well, anywhere you want! If you could find any use out of these circuits, I couldn't be more glad.
